# react-leaflet-v3-draw
React wrapper to leaflet-draw library, compatible with react-leaflet v3

The code is under-development, and has a bug that make the react context to not be passed when used in another library. If you know how to fix it, feel free to open a PR.

Just wrap your component into <LeafLetDrawProvider></LeafLetDrawProvider> and use the useDraw() hook.
